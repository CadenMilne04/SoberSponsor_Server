# Backend Development Guide
By: Caden Milne

## 🧑‍💻 Develop Locally:

### 🚨 Requirements:
- Node + NPM https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
- Nodemon https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon (this allows for automatic reloads as you are developing.)
- Postman https://www.postman.com/ (for testing the api without using a frontend.)
- A text editor (any)

### ✅ Intructions:
1. Clone repo, or Pull
2. run `npm i`
3. run `node index.js` or, `nodemon index.js` 
4. use postman to make api requests, or optionally run the frontend and test that way.

## 🧐 General:
- Please submit a pull request with changes + name it well.
- Please adhere to the best practices for writing code, structuring the project, and naming/commenting.
